  "body": "Hello,\n\nMy name is Quentin Chenevier. I live in [Toulouse, France](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toulouse). If you are interested in better knowing me, here are 3 things you might want to know about me:\n- I like **Machines**\n- I like **Humans**\n- I like to **discuss** about it\n\n## Why I like Machines\n\nI've studied many different machines and I'm really happy to study complex systems built by Humans.\n\nI graduated in 2010 from the [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), which is a great place to learn science & technology. From there, I had the opportunity to work on **amazingly complex** machines which fly in all kind of environments:\n- In space, like [spectrometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_atmospheric_sounding_interferometer)\n- In the sky, like [cockpits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit)\n- In the cloud, like [data science apps](http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2017/06/airbus-launches-new-open-aviation-data-platform--skywise--to-sup.html)\n\nAll those machines have one thing in common: they **process huge amounts of Information**. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/07/5787b18ade0a3.jpg\" width=600>\n<br>\nThe <i>Ecole Polytechnique</i> is a military school. We have funny hats, and we are proud of it.\n</p>\n\n## Why I like Humans\n\nI've discovered meditation in 2016 and it's helping me to understand my own thinking processes and having empathy for others. As a result, I started to read a lot about psychology, sociology and cognitive sciences. Since then, the beauty of the Human's mind and the complexity of its inner workings has never stopped to amaze me.\n\nI graduated an MBA in 2018 from the [Toulouse Business School](http://www.tbs-education.fr/en), which is a great place to learn business, sociology & management. From there, I began to be passionate about how organizations work. After all, they are complex systems made of Humans & Machines made by Humans.\n\n> Note: I will publish soon my MBA thesis on **Digitalization & Organisations**.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"http://www.aerospace-mba.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/photo-de-diplomes.jpg\" width=600>\n<br>\nWe also have funny hats in <i>Toulouse Business School</i> and we are also proud of it.\n</p>\n\n## I like to discuss\n\nI would by happy to discuss with you, feel free to contact me:\n- on twitter: [@q_chenevier](https://twitter.com/q_chenevier)\n- on linkedin: [@qchenevier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qchenevier/)\n- on medium: [@qchenevier](https://medium.com/@qchenevier)\n\n"
